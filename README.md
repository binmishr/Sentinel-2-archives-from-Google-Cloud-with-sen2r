# Sentinel-2-archives-from-Google-Cloud-with-sen2r

Retrieving Sentinel-2 data from official repositories (Copernicus Open Access Hub) for time series analysis has recently become particularly laborious, since products older than 30 days cannot be directly downloaded (users have to order them from Long Term Archive, with the chance to retrieve corrupted archives). To bypass these problems, the possibility to search and download Sentinel-2 data from Google Cloud was recently implemented in the R package sen2r. This functionality can be exploited without a paid Google Cloud account: it is sufficient to install the Google Cloud SDK and configure it with a free Google account.

The codeset with other instructions are attached on the .docx file in this repository.
